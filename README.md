# germanHTRtrainingDATA
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) as a task of deep learning needs images of handwritten samples from different writers. Of course, there are many open source projects with training data for HTR tasks in different languages (like RIMES, IAM, CVL etc.), 
but not a specific german database with all german specific letters (like Ä, ä, Ö, ö, Ü, ü and ß). 
For example: In a scope of application of recognizing handwritten answers from open-ended-questions in paper and pencil questionnaires (PAPI) from german respondents a HTR-software (like HTR-scheidl) can't recognize german specific letters without 
specific training (upload picture for example).    
Therefore, due my master thesis i collected a small sample of 3,349 handwritten images from 288 writers from an amount of 650 different german terms of occupations.
